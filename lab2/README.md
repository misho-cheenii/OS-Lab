## Project 1â€”UNIX Shell

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface
that accepts user commands and then executes each command in a separate
process. Your implementation will support input and output redirection.
Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait()
and dup2() system calls and can be completed on any Linux, UNIX, or macOS
system.
